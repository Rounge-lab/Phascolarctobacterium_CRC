# Phascolarctobacterium_CRC

This repository contains code for data analysis used to generate results in the paper "Species-level verification of Phascolarctobacterium association to colorectal cancer".

## Data analyses
The script used for preparation of datasets is the. The script used for analyses of the data is the [/scripts/data_generation.R](https://github.com/Rounge-lab/Phascolarctobacterium_CRC/blob/main/scripts/data_analyses.R). Required R packages include tidyverse, rstatix, dplyr, vegan, enrichplot and MicrobiomeProfiler.

In this study we used four different cohorts to verify a previously reported association between Phascolarctobacterium species and colorectal cancer. One of these cohorts was the publicly available [CuratedmetagenomeData](https://waldronlab.io/curatedMetagenomicData/articles/curatedMetagenomicData.html).
